# Requirements
Building Godot from source with the dungeon module

# Pre-Built Godot Editor
### (as of 6/20/2018)
I've added a folder (/godot-editors) with a pre-built Godot Editor to prevent the need
to compile Godot from source with the Dungeon Module. This will allow
for you to quickly play with the source code!

Have fun!
